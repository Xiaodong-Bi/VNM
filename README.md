========================
         Usage
========================
-----------------------------------------------------------
This package contains a Matlab implementation of the Blind image quality assessment by visual neuron matrix(VNM-NN).

---------------------------------------------------
For quality evaluation, you can just run 'DemoTest' as follows:

load('VNM.mat');  % load the feature detector (a matrix of size 128*768 generated by running TrainW(10000,16,16))
score = sim(net, B);  % net and B represent network and feature respectively

The quality scores are between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the same quality as the reference image.
---------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------
The training stage generates a visual neuron matrix VNM which can be used for extracting features from image.

---------------------------------------------------


Moreover, this package provides four examples for testing this algorithm on CSIQ.
You can download the database from:
CSIQ  http://vision.okstate.edu/?loc=csiq
You can also LIVE, TID2013 LIVEMD, KADID-10k database for testing
